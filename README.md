'etudes' for common and creative webpage layouts, feel free to improvise

<strong>Special thanks to <i>DarkCode</i> and <i>Online Tutorials</i> on yotube for their brilliant work, and @ajycc20 as an delightful and dedicated web developer for his help.</strong>

I'll try my best to give the exact reference of each of my practice (like web links, 'raw' codes, etc)...
